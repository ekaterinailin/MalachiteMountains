## Description

We conducted observations of three nearby mid-M dwarfs with the High-Resolution Spectrograph (HRS) at the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT, DDT proposal code: 2019-2-DDT-006). We obtained spectra in its red arm over a wavelength range of 5,500-8,900 Angström with a spectral resolution of about 40,000 in medium-resolution mode. The observations were carried out on February 08 and February 09, 2020. The data were reduced with the PEPSI data reduction software (Strassmeier et al. 2018). The reduction followed the standard steps of bias overscan detection and subtraction, scattered light extraction from the inter-order space and subtraction, definition of échelle orders, optimal extraction of spectral orders, wavelength calibration, and a self-consistent continuum fit to the full two-dimensional (2D) image of extracted orders.
